/*

 // library needs to be implemented as BST - Jonathan/Trenten
 
 // user map needs to be finalized
 // needs to be integrated with UI
 
 // both need to be integrated with UI
 
3 options:
 // currentUser point to user in map
 // currentUser as a disjoint, separate user
		// all data would be copied
		// if the user was updated,
			// delete old user to map
			// add new user 
 // detect if change was made in bool variable
		// copy data from user in UI function to the map, save the map
 // else save the map
 
 
 
 // both need to file I/O
 // BST in order
 // 1. traversal algorithm I/O in current order
		// use current functions,
			// update to work with JSON file
			// input and output need to be in the same format
